# Airflow-projects

My personal Airflow projects, starting with code from a course and supplemented by my custom DAGs as prototypes for my current workplace projects.

This project is a reference from "The Complete Hands-on Introduction to Apache Airflow" (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-hands-on-course-to-master-apache-airflow) by Marc Lamberti
